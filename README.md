## Genetic Algorithm Neural Network 
The purpose of this repository is to demonstrate neural network learning through genetic algorithms. This repository is paired with an article available [here](https://wfale.net).

## Configuration
Configuring the program is done through the 'config.hpp' file located in the include directory.

## Compilation
    mkdir build
    cd build
    cmake -G "MinGW Makefiles" ..
    make (or 'mingw32-make' on Windows with MinGW)

## Run
From the build directory:

    ./EvoNN.exe
